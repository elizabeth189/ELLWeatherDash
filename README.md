# ELL Weather Dashboard

## Description

I wanted to take the tools I have learned in class using web APIs to create this functioning app that allowsa user to view a 5-day weather forcast for whichever city they would like! It is an easy to use site that is user-friendly. A user is prompted to input a city and they are then given the temperature, wind, and humidity of that city for the next 5 days!
